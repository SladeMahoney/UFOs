# UFOs

## Technology Used: JavaScript, Bootstrap, Html

## Challenge
The purpose of this challenge was to create and update a table for our data on UFO sightings, and create filters so that users of our website can filter our data by date, state, city, shape, and country. This will allow our users an easy, straightforward experience with our website. 

I created 5 total filter options on the website and used the js variable "this" to enable my filters to be appended or deleted dynamically. One additional fix I would recommend is to somehow be able to add new data to this site, possibly through web scraping. The other option would be to make the filters a bit less exact in how they search. For example, if you add an extra space after "el cajon " then the app does not find "el cajon".
